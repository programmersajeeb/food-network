          About Bobby
        </h2>
        <p>
          Bobby discovered his culinary identity at the age of 17, working as a cook at the famed theatre district haunt, Joe Allen’s. The job had been arranged by his father, who was a partner in the restaurant. After a short time, Joe Allen himself became so impressed by Bobby’s talents that he paid the young cook’s tuition to The French Culinary Institute.

              <p>
                This quick, flavorful and healthy side is done from fridge to table in under 30 minutes. We trim off the top and bottom of the squash, poke it all over and cook it in the microwave in a fraction of the time it would take to roast it.
